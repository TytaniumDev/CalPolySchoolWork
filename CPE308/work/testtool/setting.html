      <h2 class="title">Operational Setting</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>There are three operational settings for the Test Tool: (1) test  creator with a question and answers database for teachers' use; (2) Online test  taking tool for students with an &quot;open book&quot; setting; (3) Offline  test giving/taking tool for students and teachers in a &quot;closed book&quot;  setting.<br/>
      
      The test tool will be Java-based, so any computer that can run Java can  run the test tool. This applies to all applications of the test tool, including  test creation and test taking.<br/>
      There are multiple settings in which the test tool could be used. For  the teacher (the main customer), the test tool will enable them to create and  modify a database of questions and answers, as well as generate tests for their  students in a number of ways.<br/>
      For the students, the test tool will allow them to take an entire test  on the computer, and have a good interface for answering questions ranging from  multiple choice to coding.<br/>
      For the test givers, the test tool will allow for remote or at home  test taking, as well as local, &quot;closed book&quot; test taking in which one  host machine running the test tool software can host the test for the students  to take on their slave machines. This makes it so that the students are able to  use computers to take the test, but not have access to any other functions of  the computer other than just taking the test.<br/>

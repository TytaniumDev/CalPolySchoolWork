      <p>They should then select the Check Boxes item under the Type of Question pulldown menu. Then the following will appear and should be filled out by the user:</p>


      <ul><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> The difficulty of the question, from 1 to 5. A number can be entered in the box, or the up and down arrows can be used to adjust the number.</li>





        <li><strong>Time Allowed:</strong> The time allowed for the question in minutes. A number can be entered in the box, with any value. A time of 0 will give the student unlimited time to answer the question.</li>





        <li><strong>Class:</strong> The class this question is designed for. Previously entered classes can be selected from the drop down box. To add a new class, the user simply types in the class name into the field. When the user selects Done after all of the other fields are filled out, the class will be added to the drop down box for selection in future question adds.</li>
        <li><strong>Type of Question:</strong> A drop down menu containing all of the possible question types.</li>





        <li><strong>Question:</strong> The text of the question.</li>





        <li><strong>Answer:</strong> The answer to the question, arranged in check boxes. By default, 2 check boxes are provided with the first one checked. By double clicking on the check box text, it becomes editable and an answer can be put there. Clicking on the check box itself toggles the check mark. The check mark represents a correct answer (there may be more than one checkmark to create a completely correct answer).</li>





        <li><strong>HTML File:</strong> The optional attached HTML file to replace the question. This allows for images, videos, etc. to be put into the questions. By clicking the link icon to the right of the text box, the user can browse for a file located on their computer.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>





        <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> When the user presses this button, the user is returned to the main database screen, and no question will have been added.</li>





        <li><strong>Done</strong>: When the user presses this button, the question will be put into the database as described. The user will then be returned to the main database screen.</li>

      <ul><li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> The difficulty of the question, from 1 to 5. A number can be entered in the box, or the up and down arrows can be used to adjust the number.</li>





        <li><strong>Time Allowed:</strong> The time allowed for the question in minutes. A number can be entered in the box, with any value. A time of 0 will give the student unlimited time to answer the question.</li>

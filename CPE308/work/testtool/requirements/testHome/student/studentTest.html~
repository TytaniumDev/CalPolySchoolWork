      <p>The top left of the screen indicates any known test question errors as noted by the proctor. The Status window has some basic information for the student to keep track of while taking the test. The Previous and Next question button behave as expected once the test has been started.</p>
      <p>On the right of the window, there is a question list. This list provides a way for the student to see the active question, and also get a good idea of which questions he has already submitted answers for. Once the test is started, clicking on a Question in the Question List results in bringing up the Question in the main pane. Questions that have answers submitted are not able to be selected in the question list.</p>

      <p>Figure 2.4.2.2.2 outline a student taking each type of question available to a test creator. The first is an example of a checkbox question from the database. A student can select any of the given options allowing for multiple correct answers.</p>

      <p>Figure 2.4.2.2.3 shows what a drawing question looks like. When a drawing question is first displayed it is shown with a blank <em>Drawing Canvas</em>. This is where the student may draw his answer. If a student clicks on a shape or "Text Box" underneath the &quot;Drawing Tools&quot; text, it will allow the student to draw in the canvas. The &quot;Erase&quot; option will allow a student to erase aspects of the drawing.</p>

      <p>Figure 2.4.2.2.9 shows a matching question. This provides the student with three blank text fields
      next to the parts of the question that need to be matched to the answers. On the right are the answer choices.

      <p>Figure 2.4.2.2.12 is an example of a point and click question. In this type of question, a student
      is asked to identify the error in the code by clicking where the error is. This will draw a circle around
      the location that the student clicked to indicate the error. The student may click multiple times, but 
      only one circle will be drawn, based on the last location of a student's click. This is shown in Figure 
      2.4.2.2.13.</p>

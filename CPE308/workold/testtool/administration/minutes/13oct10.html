<u><em>Some comments the professor made: </em></u>
</br> </br>
- He talked about the Practice Test option 
<p>
- Alternate order of organizing the Functional requirements
</br></br>
- Test Generation: Need specific rules for choosing the questions in the 
"Lazy section". Should be deterministic not random.
</p>
<p>
- Database: Question dialogues should correspond to the columns. All questions
should have the same properties/layout. Consistency.
</p>
<p>
- Test Reports: Think about how the students receive their scores. Think about
a central place for test generating, storing, grading, and viewing. 
What path will the test take from being generated, stored, taken, graded, and
its results posted. 
</p>
<p>
- Grading: Proposed a UI that can isolate specific questions and view them across all students

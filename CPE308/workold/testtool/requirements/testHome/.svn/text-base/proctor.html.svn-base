          <p>Test administration is done in the top left of the screen. Select Test allows
          for a proctor to choose the test (with the name displayed to the right). When a
          new test is chosen, the information for that test is displayed in the Test Information
          box. 
          </p><p>
          The student list shows the current list of students that are eligible to take 
           the test.  The add and remove buttons allow a proctor to add or remove 
           students from the list if need be. Status indicates if the student has said they
           are ready to take a test.
          </p><p>
          Administrate Test takes control of student computers and forces them to the student 
           authentication screen. Practice test does the same, but indicates that the test is
           for practice only and will not be graded.</p>
           <p>
          Messages window displays a history of all messages posted by students and the proctor.
          This can be used to tell students that the test will begin shortly and answer any last
          minute questions.</p>

         <p>After a Proctor clicks "Administrate test" this screen is displayed. Test selection is
         no longer allowed, and a new section for Known Errors appears.</p>
         <p>Students in Test Room now displays the number of questions completed by each student.</p>

          <p><strong>2.8.1. Files Used by the Questions Database</strong></p></a>
          <p>There is one type of file used by the Questions Database, called a database file. Database files contain the following information:</p>
          <ul class = nested>
            <li>All of the Database Questions, which hold all of the standard data for a question as seen in Section 2.2: 
              <ul class=nested>
                <li>Class the question is for</li>
                <li>Difficulty</li>
                <li>Time Allowed</li>
                <li>Last Used Date</li>
                <li>Type of Question</li>
                <li>Question</li>
                <li>Answer</li>
                <li>Optional attached HTML file</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          All of this information is stored in a single database file created by the user. In this way, the single file encapsulates all questions in the Questions Database.

         This is the second step of the Test Generation process. This step allows the Instructor to specify
	 more search parameters to further narrow down the Question that he wants.

	    This step allows the Instructor to input some more parameters:
	    </br>
	    <ol class="nested">
	       <li> The first optional input is a way for the instructor to specify the difficulty level of his questions
	            and how many questions he wants with that difficulty level. If the instructor does not specify as many
		    questions as the total number of questions he specified in step 1, the generator, using the search paramters
		    already given, will choose questions to make up the difference. </br> If the instructor specifies more questions
		    than he did in step 1, the generator will follow the search parameters of step 2.  </li>
	       <li> The second optional input allows the Instructor to choose questions that were made after a certain date. This is to 
	            prevent the addition of outdated Questions into the test. The Instructor can specify a Day, Month, and Year. 
	       <li> The third optional input allows the instructor to search for Questions by keywords. The generator will search the 
	            Question database for Questions that contains the specified keywords. Then it will display the matches to the 
		    instructor in the box below the search bar. </br> The instructor can choose to add the question by checking the check
		    box to the left of the question body. If the instructor wants to find out more about a particular question, he can 
		    click the database button and he will be able to see all the attributes of the question in the question database.</li>

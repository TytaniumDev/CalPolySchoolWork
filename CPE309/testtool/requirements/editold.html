2.3.2. Editing Questions
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are two different ways to edit questions in the database. Ultimately,
each way results in the same GUI screen, but the manner in which questions are selected 
for editing is different. The two options are right-clicking a question, and pressing 
the "Edit" button on the main GUI in Figure 2.3.1.

Once the user either right clicks a question and scrolls down to edit or ticks one or more questions' tick boxes, they will
be presented with the above question editing dialog. Initially, the fields in the question dialog will be blank. These fields
will be filled out by the user. Not all of the fields must be filled to add a question to database, although the following fields
are required:
<ul>
<li> Course </li>
<li> Question </li>
<li> Answer </li>

An example completed dialog box is shown below:

Once the user fills out at least the required fields, he will click OK and the question(s) will be changed in
the database. The edit operation has now completed.

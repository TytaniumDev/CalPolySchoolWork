<h3>2.6.3.1  Grade By Student</h3>
<p>
This scenario describes the actions an instructor can perform on tests for which
grading has not been completed on a student by student basis.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.3.1.a","View Test Page","images/ViewTest.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can add notes to a student response by clicking in the notes
textbox.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.3.1.b","Write Notes","images/AddNote.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can also change the number of points a student receives for
a particular question.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.3.1.c","Change Score","images/ChangeScore.png"); ?>

<p>
Once the professor is done editing the questions in the test, he can save
the changes by clicking the <em>Save Changes</em> button at the bottom of
the page. If undesired changes were made, instead the professor clicks
<em>Cancel Changes</em> and none of the changes write to the database.

<h3>
1.5.2 Fain & Company Test Generator Review
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The Test Generator created by Fain & Company has been around since 1999. During its 11 years, it has had time to
mature and become an excellent product with a wide array of useful features. However, given the large number of
options, they must be implemented in an easy to use interface that makes sense. This is where the Test Generator
falls short. The Test Generator GUI is fairly cluttered and common actions such as adding single questions to a
database are not immediately apparent. The Test Generator makes an attempt to ease the frustration of the user by
constantly having blank info panels filled with tutorial information, but this is insufficient.  Overall, this tool
feels very powerful, but itâ€™s complicated UI often hinders timely completion of simple tasks.

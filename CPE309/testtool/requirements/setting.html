Operational Setting
</h3>
<p><br>There are two operational settings for the Test Tool
software.
</p>
<ul>
   <ul>
      <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1<sup>st</sup> Tier: Primary use
      is in the Computer Science department at Cal Poly as functioning
      test taking software</p>
      </li><li><p>2<sup>rd</sup> Tier: Outside of Cal Poly for personal use as
      practice test taking software for students or software used for take-home tests</p>
   </li></ul>
</ul>
<p> The primary and most suitable setting for the Test Tool software is in a designated classroom in the Computer Science department at Cal Poly where it can be used for quizzes and exams to be taken by the users. The Test Tool's primary features are designed based on this setting and the primary customer's view points as noted in the personnel section of this document.  </p>
<p>Given the intent to develop a general-purpose product, the customer has made a conscience effort to exclude setting-specific features from the Test Tool requirements.</p>
<p>Alternative settings for the Test Tool would be in a students home for personal use as either a tool for practice test taking or take-home tests given by the instructor.</p>

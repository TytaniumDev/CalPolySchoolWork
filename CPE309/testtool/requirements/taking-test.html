<p>
The scenarios that are in this section describe a student taking an exam that the instructor
has distributed. The tool piggybacks off of the Cal Poly Portal authentication
system. As a result, the user does not have to explicitly log in using the program.
</p>

<p>
After loading the page, the software will go to a home screen, where the user 
can <b>Take a Test</b> or <b>View Test Results</b>.

<b>Take a Test</b> screen. Here the student will choose an exam to take.

The student will click on the exam he wishes to take and will be taken to the
exam itself. The instructor will have set up how many questions per page will 
be shown, and the student will see the first X questions. Clicking <b>Back Home</b>
will take the student back to the <b>Home Screen</b>.

Here the user may do several things. If the user clicks either <b>Previous Page</b>
or <b>Next Page</b> the user will be taken to the previous or next page of exam
questions, respectively. On coding questions, students may use their own IDE to
answer the question and they will also be provided the testing script to test
their own solution. These are accessed by clicking the <b>External IDE</b> and
<b>Test Code</b> buttons, respectively.
</p>

<p>
If the user clicks <b>Submit</b>, the exam will be submitted in its
entirety and the user will no longer be able to work on it. If automatic grading
is configured, then the user will be taken to a scoring screen, where the user
may see his preliminary grade and individual results on each question. Click <b>Back Home</b> 
to go back to the Home screen.

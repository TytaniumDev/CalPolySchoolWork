1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The problems that will be addressed by the TestTool are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> to provide the option to generate tests used to evaluate student knowledge of the class material using small amounts of paper.</li>
<li> to provide a better alternative for instructors on the Cal Poly campus for test generation, as compared to Blackboard.</li>
<li> to provide the ability for students to view and take practice tests.</li>
<li> to provide test taking functionality for the students in which completed tests are submitted to the instructor.</li>
<li> to provide the instructor the ability to assign each student an individual score on a particular exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many software tools available today, whether obtained commercially or as open source
software, that solve these problems.  However, the TestTool contains additional, useful
features that make it a more appealing choice than existing software.  These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The ability to generate and administer program code questions</li>
<li> The ability to include graphics in test questions in an easy, convenient manner</li>
</ul>

2.1.  User Interface Overview
</h3>
</a>
<p>
Upon invoking the test tool, the test tool displays a screen based on the logged in user's credentials. If the user is an instructor, the test tool will invoke a screen shown in <a href="#2.1.1">figure 2.1.1</a>.
<hr>
<a name="Figure Initial screen">
<a name="Initial screen">
<p align=center>
<a name="2.1.1"><img src="images/splash_screen_instructor.gif" border="1"></a>
</p>
</a>
<p align=center> <i>Figure 2.1.1:  Initial screen for instructor.</i></p>

<p>If the user is a student, the test tool invokes the screen shown in <a href="#2.1.2">figure 2.1.2</a>.</p>

<p align=center>
<a name="2.1.2"><img src="images/splash_screen_student.gif" border="1"></a>
</p>
</a>
<p align=center> <i>Figure 2.1.2:  Initial screen for student.</i></p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

The initial display consists of two windows depending on the logged-in user's credentials. If the user is an instructor, the system will present the user with <a href="#2.1.1">Figure 2.1.1</a>, allowing the instructor to dive deeper into the test tool program. The tool will allow instructors to <a href="generatingatest-overview.html">generate exams for students</a>, <a href="questionbank-top.html">add/edit/remove questions from the database</a>, <a href="handling-top.html">handle a test in a secure environment to students</a>, <a href="#">view test results after the examinations are turned in</a>, and <a href="#">perform student administrative tasks</a> such as allowing only a certain subset of students to take the test that is being deployed.
<br><br>
First, the users credentials are checked to see if they are allowed into the system set by the instructor's "student administration" windows. The student has an option to "Take A Test" and the system will display a practice/official exam based on the instructor's preferences. The student also has the ability to <a href="#">view past results</a> on any exams taken.

2.3.1. Add or Edit Questions
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are two different ways to add or edit questions to the database. The first way is to add or edit the question using the "Add" or "Edit" buttons shown on 
the main GUI in <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">figure 2.3.1</a>. The other way to add or edit a question is to right click on an existing 
question or an empty space in the database, and choose to either add a question above, or below the selected question or to edit the selected question. For these scenarios, 
the user begins with the blank question bank pictured in <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">figure 2.3.1</a>.
<br><br>
<B>Adding a question using a button</B>
<br>
Once a user clicks the "add" button on the <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">main question database GUI</a>, they are presented with a question
addition dialog. This dialog is shown below in Figure 2.3.2.

is displayed. At this point, the user then clicks "Add Q After". This brings up the same question addition dialog 
as illustrated in Figure 2.3.2 above.

type of questions are shown below:

<B>Inputting HTML (WYSIWYG formatting) into a question</B><br>

formatting to the question dialog, although HTML formatting is always available. When the user clicks "Short Answer" in the dropdown menu in figure 2.3.2 above, 
the <a href="./images/questionbank-saempty.png">short answer dialog</a> is displayed. The user then completes the dialog as shown below in figure 2.3.25.

The user now proceeds to add more questions. This leads to a fully-populated question bank, where "fully" means the question bank is populated to 
a level sufficient for test generation in section 2.2. Furthermore, a significant number of CPE103 questions are added to the question bank to a level such
 that all future CPE103 questions can be assumed to already exist in the question bank.
<br> 
<B>Editing a question using a button</B>
<br>
Once a user clicks the "edit" button on the <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">main question database GUI</a>, they is presented with a question
editing dialog. This dialog is in the same format as the addition dialog illustrated in <a href="./images/addquestion-base.png">Figure 2.3.2.</a> referenced earlier.
<br>
<br>
Once this dialog appears, at least some of the fields are populated as shown below in Figure 2.3.27.

<br>
<br>
From there, the user will use the textboxes and dropdown menus to add information to the question or change the information currently in the question. 
In the example in Figure 2.3.28 below a user has decided to remove the author from the question. As with the add dialog, the only required fields are:
<ul>
<li> Course </li>
<li> Question </li>
<li> Answer </li>
</ul>

<B>Editing a question using right-clicks</B>
<br>
Once the user right clicks a question in the question bank, a dropdown similar to <a href="./images/WireMainFilled-click.png">Figure 2.3.3</a>
is displayed. At this point, the user then clicks "Edit Q". This brings up the same edit dialog 
as illustrated in Figure 2.3.27 above. Once the user completes the dialog in the same fashion as Figure 2.3.28 and clicks OK
the question database will display that the question has been edited. This is illustrated in the above example in Figure 2.3.29.

<h3>2.6.3. Automatic Grading</h3>
<p>This section describes the process of automatic grading.<p>

<p>Once a student submits a test, the automatic grading function executes in the
background. The automatic grading function iterates through each individual
question in the test and grades the questions independently of one another. For
each question, it looks up the type of the question in the question database and
grades by the following rules for each question type.</p>

<p>The automatic grading script grades these types of questions:<p>
<ul>
   <li>Multiple choice</li>
   <li>True/False</li>
   <li>Matching</li>
   <li>Fill in the blank</li>
   <li>Code</li>
</ul>

<h4>Multiple Choice</h4>
<p>For a multiple choice question, the program gives student response points if
and only if his or her only selection matches the only correct selection. If the
response matches the correct answer, then the program gives the response full
credit, where full credit is the number of points assigned to the question by
the instructor when creating the test. If the student response does not match
the correct answer, then the student receives zero points.</p>

<h4>True/False</h4>
<p>The program grades a true/false question the same way that it grades a
multiple choice question is graded, but with exactly two possible responses 
instead of a varying number of possible responses.</p>

<h4>Matching</h4>
<p>The program grades a matching question by checking each of the student's
responses against the correct responses. The program calculates a percentage of
correct answers selected and multiplies that percentage by the full score in
order to determine the student's score on the section. For example, if a
matching question has three responses and the student gets one correct, the
percentage of correct answers is 33.33...%. If the instructor assigns 6 points
to the question, then the student receives 33.33% times 6, which is 2 points. 
</p>

<h4>Fill in the blank</h4>
<p>For a fill in the blank question, the program compares the student's response
string to the correct response string for equality. The program is case
insensitive and strips preceding and trailing whitespace. The program gives a
response points if and only if his or her response string matches the professors
response string.</p>

<h4>Code</h4>
<p>The program grades a code question by executing a shell script provided by
the instructor with the file containing the student's code submission as the
first parameter. The shell supports all bourne shell commands and all utilities
specified by in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008. The shell script is run for each student
response, and the shell script must write one number to standard output to be
used as the student's grade. Any errors will mark the grade as a zero. If the
shell script takes longer than thirty seconds to execute, the program terminates
the script.  The program runs the script in a sandboxed environment, so the
individual scripts and programs are separated from each other and from the rest
of the system.</p>

<h4>Other question types</h4>
Every other question type must be graded manually by the intstructor. The
program does not provide immediate feedback for the students for the remaining
question types.

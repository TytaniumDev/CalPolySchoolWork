<h4>
1.5.6.  Random Test Generator PRO
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Random Test Generator PRO claims to be a very flexible and powerful tool for
generating exams for any level of student. It supports an infinite number of
questions and an infinite number of test banks. Each test bank can represent a
topic or a class or any other number of things. It also has a multitude of
question types. As a simple, usable tool, RTGP fulfills several of the requirements
for the Test Tool project.

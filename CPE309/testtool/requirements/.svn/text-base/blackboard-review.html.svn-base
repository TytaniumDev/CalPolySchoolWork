<P>Blackboard is a web-based learning system that was developed by Stephen Gilfus in 1997.
It incorporates muliple features such as communication, test creation and distribution, and grading into one application with an easy to use interface. As with many other products with a simple UI, its most serious limitation is customization. For typical courses, Blackboard's ability to consolidate all aspects of the classroom into one central location works very well. Furthermore, Blackboard is also able to automate tasks such as grading and updating grade books, thus increasing the efficiency of the instructor. However, if an instructor tries to use Blackboard for atypical exams, such as those that contain programming, Blackboard's limitations immediately become apparent. </P>

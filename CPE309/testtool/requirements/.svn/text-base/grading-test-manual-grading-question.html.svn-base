<h3>2.6.3.2  Grade By Question</h3>
<p>
This scenario describes the actions an instructor can perform on tests for which
grading has not been completed on a question by question basis.
</p>
<p>
The default grading view shows one student's test. If an instructor wishes to
grade all responses for the same question at once, he clicks on <em>All
Responses</em> link in the upper right-hand corner of the corresponding question
box.
<p>
<? echo image("2.6.3.2.a","View Test Page","images/ViewTest.png"); ?>

<p>
The grade by question page shows the responses for each student on a single
question.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.3.2.b","View Question Page","images/ViewQuestion.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can add notes to a student response by clicking in the notes
textbox and typing any remarks.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.3.2.d","After Adding Notes","images/QuestionNote.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can also change the number of points a student receives for
a particular question.
</p>

<p>
Once the professor is done editing the questions in the test, he can save
the changes by clicking the <em>Save Changes</em> button at the bottom of
the page. If undesired changes were made, instead the professor clicks
<em>Cancel Changes</em> and none of the changes write to the database.

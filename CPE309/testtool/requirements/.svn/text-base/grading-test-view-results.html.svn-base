<h3>2.6.1. View Results</h3>
<p>
This scenario describes the actions an instructor can perform on tests for which
grading has already been completed.
</p>

<p>
When an instructor goes to the grading section, he sees a list of all tests that
have been deployed. The tests are divided up into three sections: in-progress,
pending, and completed.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.1.a","Grading Categories","images/GradingCategories.png"); ?>

<p>
The in-progress category of tests lists all of the tests that the instructor
deployed which have not ended. All links in this section link directly to the
<em>Proctoring an Exam</em> page where the instructor can view the current
status of each student. Both proctored tests and take at home tests are
displayed in this section.
</p>

<p>
The pending category of tests lists all of the tests for which the ending time
has been reached, but grading is not complete. Each of the links in this section
link to the <em>Manual Grading</em> page where the instructor grades tests.
</p>

<p>
The completed category of tests lists all of the tests for which the instructor
has marked as graded. The links in this section go to the <em>View Grades</em>
page, where the instructor can view the completed tests, make grade changes, and
export grades.
</p>

<p>
When an instructor goes to the <em>View Grades</em> page by selecting a
particular test, he sees a list of students that took the test. Alongside each
student is the student's score on each section of the test.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.1.b","View Grades Page","images/ViewGrades.png"); ?>

<p>
To view a test, the instructor clicks on the corresponding student's name. The
<em>View Test</em> page is similar to the page a student sees when taking the
test, but has a few options added for the instructor. He has the ability to
write notes for the student, change the number of points the student receives,
and change the student's answer for a particular question. 
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.1.c","View Test Page","images/ViewTest.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can add notes to a student response by clicking in the notes
textbox.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.1.d","Write Notes","images/AddNote.png"); ?>

<p>
The professor can also change the number of points a student receives for
a particular question.
</p>

<? echo image("2.6.1.e","Change Score","images/ChangeScore.png"); ?>

<p>
Once the professor is done editing the questions in the test, he can save
the changes by clicking the <em>Save Changes</em> button at the bottom of
the page. If undesired changes were made, instead the professor clicks
<em>Cancel Changes</em> and none of the changes write to the database.
</p>

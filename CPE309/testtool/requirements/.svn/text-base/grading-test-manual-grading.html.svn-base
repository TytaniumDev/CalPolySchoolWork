<h3>2.6.3. Manual Grading</h3>

<p>
This scenario describes the actions an instructor can perform on tests for which
grading has not been completed.
</p>

<p>
The main instructor grading page divides the tests up into three categories.
The pending category of tests lists all of the tests for which the ending 
time has been reached, but grading is not complete. Each of the links in this 
section link to the Manual Grading page where the instructor grades tests.
</p>

<p>
When an instructor goes to the View Grades page by selecting a particular test, 
he sees a list of students that took the test. Alongside each student is the 
student's score on each section of the test.
</p>

<p>
To view a test, the instructor clicks on the corresponding student's name. The
<em>Manual Grading</em> page is similar to the page a student sees when taking 
the test, but has a few options added for the instructor. He has the ability to
write notes for the student and change the number of points the student 
receives.
</p>

<p>
From the <em>Manual Grading</em> page, the professor has two main options for
grading questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="grading-test-manual-grading-student.html">Grade By Student</a></li>
<li><a href="grading-test-manual-grading-question.html">Grade By Question</a></li>
</ul>

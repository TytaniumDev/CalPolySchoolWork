1.2.  System Personnel
</h3>
</a>
<p>

The personnel involved in the Test Tool project are organized into the following groups:
<ol type="I">
<li>End Users</li>
    <ol type="A">
    <li>Students</li>
    <li>Teachers/Administrators</li>
    <li>Other Superusers</li>
    </ol>
<li>Customers</li>
<li>System Developers</li>
</ol>

<p>
End users of the Test Tool system are those who will use the application.
Students will be able to use the application to take tests that are preconfigured
in the system by Teachers/Administrators. Administrators (usually teachers) are those
who use the tool to generate tests, maintain a question database, and grade tests
that students have completed. Other superusers include TAs and other such users who
may grade exams using the tool, but may not generate exams or modify the question
database.
</p>

<p>
The primary customer is Gene Fisher. He is the representative for the faculty and
staff colleagues in the Computer Science department at California Polytechnic
State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. Gene Fisher will consult with other customers
and work with the development team to ensure that requirements are specified fully.
</p>

<p>
The System Developers include Sean Glover, Ben Voogd, Connor Lange, Nathan Mock, Sarah Hoke and Richard Steiger. This team of competent engineers will oversee the entire software
development process, from requirements analysis through product implementation and
deployment. They will work together to ensure that all proper standards are obeyed
while engineering Test Tool.

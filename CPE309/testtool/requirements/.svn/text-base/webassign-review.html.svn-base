      <p>
      WebAssign is one of the standards for online assignment and test administration.
      The primary feature that distinguishes WebAssign from other test-making tools is
      its online question database. Instructors can create their own questions or
      select questions from a large database filled with questions from textbook
      publishers and other teachers from around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is used at high schools and universities because of its flexibility in
      operating alongside other academic software. WebAssign is compatible with most
      standard registration, enrollment, authentication, and grading systems.

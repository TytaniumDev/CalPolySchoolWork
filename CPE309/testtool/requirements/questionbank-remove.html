<h3>
2.3.3. Removing Questions from the Question Bank
</h3>
<p>
There are two different ways to remove a question from the database. The first way is to remove the question from the database 
using the "Remove" button shown on the main GUI in <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">figure 2.3.1</a>. The other way to remove a question
is to right click on a question and choose to remove the question. For these scenarios, the user already has a
question bank populated like <a href="./images/questionbank-8added.png">Figure 2.3.26</a> referenced earlier.
<br>
<B>Removing a question using the Remove button</B>
<br>
In order to remove questions from the Question Bank, the user must select the question(s) she wants to remove. This is achieved by clicking one or more
 of the select boxes in the "S" column on the left of <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">figure 2.3.1</a>. In the example shown below in Figure 2.3.32, 
 the user has selected two questions to remove from the Question Bank.

After making her selection, the user then clicks the "Remove" button and the selected questions will be removed from the question database as shown below in
 Figure 2.3.33:

<B>Removing a Question Using Right-Clicks</B>
<br>
If the user right clicks the last question in the Question Bank, a dropdown similar to <a href="./images/WireMainFilled-click.png">Figure 2.3.4</a>
will be displayed. In this example the user has right clicked the last question and has selected "Remove Q" from the dropdown menu. The selected question will then be removed from the Question Bank. The Question Bank will then 
be updated to reflect the changes, as shown below in Figure 2.3.34.

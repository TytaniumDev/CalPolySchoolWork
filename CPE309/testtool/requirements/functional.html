<p>
The primary functionality of the Test Tool system is creating/maintaining a list
of questions, generating exams intelligently, and distributing them to students
who will then take the exams. The instructor is responsible for creating questions
and exams, as well as grading them when applicable. The student is responsible 
for taking the exam and is also able to view the history of all the exams he has
taken.

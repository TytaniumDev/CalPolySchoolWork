2.3.2. Search Questions

<p>
A user is able to search the Question Bank by inputting his query into the search box at the bottom 
of the <a href="./images/TestGeneratorWireMain.png">main GUI (Figure 2.3.1)</a>. As an example, the user 
has inputted "write" as his query as shown below in Figure 2.3.30:

<br>
Once the user clicks the search button (indicated by the magnifying glass) or presses "Enter" on his keyboard, the Test Tool begins to search the Question Bank for questions that contain the word "write" 
somewhere in one of the sections of the question. The Test Tool then filters the questions in the bank so that only questions returned by the search are displayed. This functionality is depicted 
in Figure 2.3.31 below:

Once the search is complete, the user can access the questions returned and perform any valid actions on them.

As outlined in the UI overview, the TestTool is comprised of two separate application programs.  The instructor-centered application enables instructors
to generate, distribute, and grade exams.  This is the main bulk of the tool.  In addition, the student-centered application enables students to take exams
and view exam results.
<br>
<br>
The largest object you will be dealing with is the QuestionBank, which is our fun way of describing a Question Database.  Each record in this database 
describes, in general, a question that can be placed on any test.  Common fields for these records include a course, question type, instructor, and 
difficulty, among others.  Inheriting this object is another question type, but specifically focused on its position within a specific test.  Thus,
a TestQuestion has all of the above fields, but also contains an index and a point value.  This TestQuestion object will be another important object
you'll be dealing with.
<br>
<br>
In addition to the Question Database, the Exam Database represents another important object utilized by our tool.  The Exam Database contains records
that represent exams that have already been generated by the instructor.  It is from this database that instructors will reach in and grab tests to
distribute.  However, the Exam Database does not just contain recently generated exams, for it also contains partially graded and fully graded
exams.  Thus, when grading an exam, the instructor will look in the same place as the student does to take his exams and view his exam results. 
Thus, because
the Exam Database has so many uses, it becomes a vital part of the design of the TestTool.
<br>
<br>
As could be expected, the main operations that come with these two databases involve adding, removing, and editing questions or exams from the 
databases.  In addition, we plan on including a sorting functionality with the QuestionBank, making it much easier for instructors to find items in what
plans to be a very large collection of questions.

2.7.  File/Edit Scenarios
</h3>
</a>

<p>
As Test Tool is a web-based UI, there is no real file or edit menus, aside from 
the ones in the browser. However, there are equivalent actions that the user may
perform that are similar to file/edit commands. Most of these commands are, however,
not explicit.
</p>

<h3>File Commands:</h3>

<h4><b>New Functionality:</b></h4>
<p>
In the professor interface, there are 2 places where "New" functionality exists. 
In Test Generation, New functionality is equivalent to choosing a type of generation.
In the Question Database, New functionality is equivalent to clicking the Add button
on the main Question Database UI.
</p>

<p>
There is no student "New" functionality.
</p>

<h4><b>Open Functionality:</b></h4>
<p>
There is 1 place where "Open" functionality exists in the professor interface. 
In the Question Database, Open functionality is equivalent to clicking <b>Edit</b>
on the main UI.
</p>

<p>
In the student interface, Open functionality exists when the student opens an exam
or opens test results.
</p>

<h4><b>Save Functionality:</b></h4>
<p>
In the professor interface, there are 2 main things that can be saved: questions 
and exams.
</p>

<p>
Questions are saved when the user presses the OK button on the "Add 
a Question to the Question Bank" dialog box (See Section 2.3.1).
</p>

<p>
Exams are saved when the user clicks <b>Save</b> on one of the Test Creation 
screens (see Section 2.2).
</p>

<p>
In the student interface, completed exams are saved when the user submits them.
</p>

<h3>Edit commands:</h3>

<p>
Any edit commands (Undo, copy, paste, etc) are embedded in the web browser and 
work exactly as they would in any web-based application (Edit commands are performed
on text).

The arrow labeled as 1 describes the test generation process.  The instructor first generates the test from his personal machine and places
it into the exam database.  The exam can then take two different paths, represented by multiple arrows described with the number 2.  If the 
instructor wants to distribute the exam in the proctored scenario, then the exams will travel to the classroom test taking machines, to be
taken by students.  However, if the instructor chooses the take at home distribution method, then the exams will travel directly
to each student's home machine.<br>
<br>
Both arrows labeled with number 3 indicate that the completed exams are sent back to the exam database, from either the classroom or personal student
computers.  Arrow 4 describes completed exams traveling to the machine of the instructor for a second time for the purpose of grading.  After the
instructor grades each exam, he sends it back to the exam database, as represented by arrow 5.  Finally, once the exam has been fully graded, it
becomes available for students to view their results, as presented through arrow 6.<br>

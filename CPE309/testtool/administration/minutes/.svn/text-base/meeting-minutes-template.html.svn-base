<ol type=1>
<li>
Record meeting minutes in a separate file for each meeting; name each file
"ddmmmyy.html", e.g.,
<blockquote>
30mar04.html
</blockquote>
If more than one meeting is held on the same day, suffix each file name with
"a", "b", "c", as necessary.  E.g., 30mar04a.html, 30mar04b.html.  Store these
files in the project directory
<blockquote>
<tt>administration/minutes/</tt>
</blockquote>
<li>
Fill in your team name where "X" appears above.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Fill in "hh:mm - hh:mm {AM,PM}, dd Month yyyy" with the time and date of the
meeting, e.g.,
<blockquote>
1:40 - 2:00 PM, 30 March 2004.
</blockquote>
<li>
Fill in the <strong>Present:</strong> line with the names of those who attended
the meeting.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Fill in the <strong>Absent:</strong> line with the names of those who did not
attend the meeting who should have (i.e., missing team members).
<br>
<br>
<li>
Fill in the <strong>Excused:</strong> line with the names of those who did not
attend the meeting who had a valid reason not to attend and who notified at
least one team leader in advance that the meeting would be missed.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Organize the minutes based on the itemized list of topics from the agenda, plus
any new topics that are discussed; record succinctly the discussion of each
topic.
<br>
<br>
<li>
As necessary, conclude the minutes with a list of <em>Action Items</em>,
including the person(s) responsible for completing the items.  Note that action
items need not record all of the normal work duties of team members, where
normal work means that prescribed in the milestone schedule.  Action items are
specific tasks to be completed other than normal work, or certain normal work
duties that require immediate attention due to neglect or other reasons that
caused a delay of completion.

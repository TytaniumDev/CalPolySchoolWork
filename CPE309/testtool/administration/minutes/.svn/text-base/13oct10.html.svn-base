<ul>
<li>Discussion of the evaluation. Unless 100% was achieved, the person responsible for a section is responsible for revising it for the next milestone.</li>
<li>Discussion of the Table of Contents. A modified order was created, specifically the test generation and question database section need to be swapped. The next milestone will contain these changes. </li>
<li>The rules that are automatically filled in during test generation need to be discussed in the scenarios. Ex. What if all criteria cannot be met? </li>
<li>Discussion of what kind of database to use. A centralized one vs multiple ones (for questions and tests). Centralized is what we're aimed for. This one will contain tests like a 'Test database'. </li>
<li>If there is no test database file formatting could be use. Pros & Cons were discussed. Although this appears to be simpler we're still leaning towards a test database as mentioned. </li>
<li>Reports of the grades will NOT contain statistics. They will contain information on the point values only. Collaboration with the Grading program is needed. </li>
</ul>

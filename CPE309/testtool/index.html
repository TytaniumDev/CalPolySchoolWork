<strong>The </strong><strong><em>Test Tool</em></strong> <strong>Project</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
We are offering an exciting new product for an academic environment that will 
allow for the easy production of exams. Once exam data is entered into a 
centralized database, the bank of questions can be automatically selected and 
compiled based on options/parameters set by the instructor. Students can take 
the exams in a secure environment with a central computer (server) serving out 
the test questions to the client computers (students). This product will save 
time for instructors because all test data will be saved, and exams can be 
intelligently generated as to not reuse old exam questions as well as 
presenting questions in a random order if specified. Statistical data can be 
made available so class performance can be accurately and precisely analyzed, 
as well as be used to intelligently generate future exams. An instructor can 
also easily generate practice exams.

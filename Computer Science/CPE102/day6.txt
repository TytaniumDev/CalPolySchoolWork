// Day 6 notes
Lab Quiz: like program1 or lab2

UML: unified modeling language

program1 UML: (all in boxes)

   ^                                |

Overwriting equals() method:
public boolean equals(Object other)
{
   if(other == null)
   {
      return false;
   }
   if(this.getClass() != other.getClass())
   {
      return false;
   }
   if(this.n != ((Fraction)other).n)
   {
      return false;
   }
   .........
}


Java docs:

/**
   Write a sentance that concisely describes what your method does.
   You may then write detailed stuff on as many lines as you wish.
   There can even be lots of sentances.
   @param x represents the age of a tortoise. Must be between 0-150, exclusive.

   @param name The name of the tortoise.

   @return Returns true when the age is correct and name is not "Bob".

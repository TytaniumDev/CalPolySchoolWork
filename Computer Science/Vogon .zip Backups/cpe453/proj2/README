Name: Tyler Holland (tyhollan)
Assignment: Project 2
Instructions: Compiles with make
              liblwp.a is made with: make liblwp.a

Note: It will run a couple processes, but then seg fault. I could not
      figure out the reason why, even after staring at it for hours.
      At least it can run the first thread, and the scheduler works.

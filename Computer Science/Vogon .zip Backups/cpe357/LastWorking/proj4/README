Assignment: Project 4
Instructions: Compiles with make
Notice: I ignore any input after a file name is given on the command line. The program will exit
         with error code 16 when input is found after a file name.
         
        Also: with the short commands, I assumed they are supposed to function as if we are using
         getopt. Therefore, for short options, the = sign is not needed, but instead the value
         needs to be immediately after the option.
         Example; -b100 is the same as --brighten=100
                  not -b=100

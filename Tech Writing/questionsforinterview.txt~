For employers:
-why are you here?
-what can you do for us?
-what kind of person are you?
-what distinguishes you from ninteen other people who can do the same tasks as you?
-can i afford you?

my 5 questions:
-what does this job involve?
-what are the skills a top employee in this job would have to have?
-are these the kinds of people i would like to work for?
-can i persuade them that i am unique and have something to offer that's different from 19 other people?
-can i persuade them to hire me at the salary i need/want?

notice the timeframe of the questions the employer is asking:
1)distant past, past
2)present
3)immediate future (best)

interviews are often lost to mosquiitoes rather than dragons

-appearance and personal habits
-nervous mannerisms
-lack of self confidence
-give them a portfolio of work at end of interview
-consideration shown to other people
-your lack of values (arrogance, blaming others, tardiness, laziness, lying, can't follow instructions, no enthusiasm, phoniness in demeanor, etc.)

Questions to ask before leaving:
-given my skills and experience, is there work here that you'd consider me for?
-when might i expect to hear from you?
-may i contact you after that date, if for any reason you haven't called me?
-can you think of anyone else who might be interested in hiring me?
